# detectjam
Detect jammer by calculatin persistent repeat half or one step beyond.

# Description
We have experienced psnd -e | psnd -d chain sometimes doesn't matches whole even except the tail.
So the origin of this mismatches can be estimated as (i) bug or infection on our computer
(ii) some ray things collide to memory cell then slips some parity check
(iii) the context on aleph_(aleph_omega) bucket collision.

So we bet they're from (iii) case, so the analogy of this can leads us to ddpmopt \[pq\] one step
after persistent prediction causes some slips on them they can be caused by some resonance on
any elsewhere as a some artificial table started computation attacking our internal states
estimation result.

So to compete them, we calculate persistent same one or half step beyond place by our predictor
also check bit by bit the collision occured or not so this is the error rate check on prediction
stability they should completely deterministic by input ones.
